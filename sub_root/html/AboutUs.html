		<h1>About Jamhour Alumni US </h1>
		<p>
			Jamhour Alumni, US Inc. is a non-profit alumni association organized in 2004 under New York State laws. It is a 501 c (3) non-profit, non political organization, founded by a group of Jamhour Alumni (Anciens de Jamhour) desiring to assist needy students attending their alma mater, ‘Collège Notre Dame de Jamhour’, in their home country of Lebanon. Since inception, and through 2013, above $1.6 million have been raised thanks to the generous contributions of its sponsors.<br />
			<br />
			‘Collège Notre Dame de Jamhour’, is run by the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church.  Gathered funds are used to cover the tuitions of deserving students unable to meet tuition expenses; more than 550 scholarships have been provided through 2013.  Special fund raisings by either a particular ‘class’ or specific individuals have also targeted the creation of modern Computer and Science Laboratories. <br />
			<br />
			The membership in the Jamhour Alumni, US Inc is a privilege extended only to former students from the ‘Collège Notre Dame de Jamhour’, its predecessor ‘The Collège of Saint Joseph’ and all membership holding alumni. <br /><br />
